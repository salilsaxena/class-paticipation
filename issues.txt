have started inserting float ask other members too, and test them too.

do we still need search.h:
  we might as finding position will be an easy task
  tryng to give .2 digit precision only

ask teammates:
  should we allow user to add integer values only?
    if `no` then you have limit 2 after decimal value!
      we have 2 options here:
        let the user add float numbers but .2f will only be visible
        OR
        user can only add .2f numbers(have to make a function for that)

Have to make save function to let user make a csv file out of it.
  set the name of saved files name.

have to take care of search.h

tag named `before_float` is made which contains totally safe build, revert back to it OR dont mere if found in any kind of confusion.
