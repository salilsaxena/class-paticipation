have started inserting float ask other members too, and test them too.

do we still need search.h: 
  we might as finding position will be an easy task 

  
ask teammates: 
  should we allow user to add integer values only?
    if `no` then you have limit 2 after decimal value!

tag named `before_float` is made which contains totally safe build, revert back to it OR dont mere if found in any kind of confusion.
