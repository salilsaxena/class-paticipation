Dont let user delete when a single column or cell is left.
  start by blocking delete function
have started inserting float ask other members too, and test them too.

do we still need search.h: 
  we might as finding position will be an easy task 

have to make avg function.
  make it return float(do I have to?)
  
ask teammates: 
  should we allow user to add integer values only?
    if `no` then you have limit 2 after decimal value!

tag named `before_float` is made which contains totally safe build, revert back to it OR dont mere if found in any kind of confusion.
