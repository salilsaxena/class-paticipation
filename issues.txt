Dont let user delete when a single column or cell is left.

have started inserting float ask other mebers too, and test them too.
do we still need search.h:

have to make avg function.
print_block must also carry indexes while indexes(merge soon).
tag named `before_float` is made which contains totally safe build, revert back to it OR dont mere if found in any kind of confusion.
