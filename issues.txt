have started inserting float ask other members too, and test them too.

error handling of maximum and minumum:
  must be done in main.c

check functionality of pos_checker(include it in main) 

add or substract cells.

add row realted functions to main(eiter make it or insert them to main)

segregate all other functons from main to helper_main.h

tag named `before_float` is made which contains totally safe build, revert back to it OR dont mere if found in any kind of confusion.
