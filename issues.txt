Dont let user delete when a single column or cell is left.

have started inserting float ask other mebers too, and test them too.

do we still need search.h: 
  we might as finding position will be an easy task 

have to make avg function.
  make it return float(do I have to?)
  add a ability to add avg to end of column or change the value to end of of the column.
  
ask teammates: should we allow user to add integer values?

tag named `before_float` is made which contains totally safe build, revert back to it OR dont mere if found in any kind of confusion.
